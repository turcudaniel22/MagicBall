# Magic Eight Ball 🎱

This project simulates a **Magic Eight Ball** using JavaScript. The user can input their question, and the program will respond with a random fortune. 

## Features 🌟

- **Personalized Greetings**: Greets the user by name if provided.
- **Randomized Responses**: The Magic Eight Ball generates one of eight random responses.
- **Interactive Console**: Accepts user questions and returns dynamic answers.
- **Control Flow Implementation**: Demonstrates the use of `switch` or `if-else` for decision making.

## How It Works 🛠️

1. The user inputs their name in the `userName` variable.
2. A personalized greeting is displayed. If no name is provided, it defaults to "Hello!".
3. The user asks a question by modifying the `userQuestion` variable.
4. The program generates a random number between 0 and 7.
5. Based on the random number, a Magic Eight Ball response is assigned using a `switch` statement.
6. The response is displayed alongside the user’s question.

## Usage Instructions 📖

1. Save the `magicEightBall.js` file to your system.
2. Open the file in a JavaScript environment like:
   - A browser console
   - Node.js
3. Modify the `userName` and `userQuestion` variables in the code.
4. Run the program to receive your random fortune.

## Example Output 🖥️

Alex asks: "Will I get a new job soon?"
The Magic Eight Ball says: "Outlook not so good"
```

## Customization 🎨

- Change the Magic Eight Ball responses to your own custom messages by modifying the `switch` statement.
- Experiment by using `if-else` statements instead of `switch` for practice.
